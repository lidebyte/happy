# Telegram's glass vs ours

Source: Telegram Android 13.1.1, commit `3de37c8cfb039452be7398909461da6288babf15`
(the same pin as `ui/NavMotion.kt`). The files are under `TMessagesProj/src/main/java/org/telegram/`:

- `ui/Components/blur3/DownscaleScrollableNoiseSuppressor.java`: the capture, downscale and blur
- `ui/Components/blur3/source/BlurredBackgroundSourceRenderNode.java` and
  `drawable/BlurredBackgroundDrawableRenderNode.java`: drawing the blur under a surface
- `ui/Components/blur3/drawable/color/impl/BlurredBackgroundProviderImpl.java` and
  `BlurredBackgroundColorProviderThemed.java`: tint, stroke and shadow for each surface
- `ui/Components/blur3/BlurredBackgroundWithFadeDrawable.java`,
  `chat/layouts/ChatActivityFadeView.java` and `DialogsActivityTopBubblesFadeView.java`: the fades
- `ui/DialogsActivity.java` (`drawBlurRect`, `blur3_InvalidateBlur`) and `ui/ChatActivity.java`
  (constructor, `ACTION_BAR_BLUR_ALPHA`, `actionBar.setupGlass`)
- `ui/Components/SizeNotifierFrameLayout.java`: the old blur path (`drawBlurRect`, `DOWN_SCALE`),
  still used below API 31
- `messenger/LiteMode.java` and `SharedConfig.chatBlurEnabled()`: the switches

## How Telegram's works (API 31+, "blur3")

**What is captured.** Telegram never blurs the whole window. Each screen collects the rects
of its visible glass surfaces, merges them, and rounds them out to 16 px
(`SourcePart.setPosition`). Only the content inside those rects is re-recorded into
RenderNodes (`IBlur3Capture.capture`). `DialogsActivity` adds 48 dp of list above and
below the bars. In a chat, the source is the wallpaper (`navbarContentSourceWallpaper`)
with the message list drawn into the noise suppressor's rects.

**Downscale and blur.** This is the frosted mode, the default whenever liquid glass is off
(`simpleMode`, `allowNoiseSuppress = false`):

| | Telegram |
|---|---|
| capture scale | 1/8 (`k = 8`): the rect is recorded at an eighth of its size |
| blur | `RenderEffect.createBlurEffect` with a full-size radius of **40 dp**, converted for the 1/8 copy through sigma: `downscaleRadius(r, s) = max(1, toRadius(toSigma(r) / s))`, where `toSigma(r) = 0.57735 r + 0.5` (hwui's own conversion) |
| tile mode | `CLAMP` |
| colour | chained `ColorMatrix.setSaturation(3f)`, so saturation ×3 |
| upscale | the RenderNode drawn with scale 8 and pivot 0,0, filtered bilinearly by the GPU |

With liquid glass on (`LiteMode.FLAG_LIQUID_GLASS`, off by default and turned off for
everyone in the `lite_mode6` migration), there is a second 1/4 pass with a 6 dp blur and
×3 saturation under an AGSL refraction shader (`liquid_glass_shader.agsl`). This file does
not cover it.

**Tint over the blur.** This is the theme's own background colour, not a grey:

| surface | light | dark |
|---|---|---|
| chat-list action bar (`DialogsActivity.drawBlurRect`), `windowBackgroundWhite` | alpha 216/255 = 0.847 | alpha 178/255 = 0.698 (`ChatActivity.ACTION_BAR_BLUR_ALPHA`) |
| chat input and side buttons (`blurredBackgroundColorProvider`), `chat_messagePanelBackground` | 216/255 | 0.76 |
| chat header islands (`topPanelChatActivity`), `chat_topPanelBackground` | 0.76 | 0.76 |
| with blur off (`checkBlurEnabled` false) | 255 (opaque) | 255 |

**Edges.** A full-width bar has none: `actionBar.setCastShadows(false)`, with no stroke.
Floating glass (the rounded header islands and the input) gets a stroke drawn as two half
round-rects: a top half and a bottom half.

| | light | dark |
|---|---|---|
| top stroke | `#FFFFFFFF`, 0.55 dp | `#20FFFFFF`, 0.55 dp |
| bottom stroke | `#FFFFFFFF`, 0.55 dp | `#14FFFFFF`, 0.55 dp |
| shadow | `#20000000`, radius 1 dp, dy 1/3 dp | none |

**Fades.** Content does not stop at a hard line under a bar:

- In a chat, `ChatActivityFadeView` draws the blurred source under the top and bottom
  zones, masked `DST_IN` with a 48 dp gradient of alpha `0, 0x60, 0xB0, 0xE8` of 285
  (0, 0.34, 0.62, 0.81). The mask holds at 0.81 past the ramp.
- On the chat list, `DialogsActivityTopBubblesFadeView` is a plain colour gradient
  (`E8, C0, 90, 00` of the background) at most 40 dp tall, under the filter tabs.

**Updates.** Every `dispatchDraw` calls `blur3_InvalidateBlur()`, but each rect is
re-recorded only when a hash of what it covers changes (`Blur3HashImpl`: positions,
colours, the list's draw hash), and the merged result node only when a part changed. While
scrolling, the work is per frame, limited to the rects under glass. When idle, it is free.
Scroll offsets modulo the scale (`onScrolled`) are for the noise-suppressing mode, which is
off by default.

**Noise and dither.** There is none. The 1/8 copy with a 40 dp blur is smooth enough.

**Fallbacks.**

- **API 31+ with blur allowed:** `chatBlurEnabled()` requires performance class AVERAGE or
  better and `LiteMode.FLAG_CHAT_BLUR` (on by default). Telegram uses blur3 as described above.
- **API 29–30, or a HIGH-class device on the old path:** `SizeNotifierFrameLayout.drawBlurRect`
  uses a RenderNode blur (`getBlurRadius()` = 60 on HIGH, ×2 saturation, `TileMode.DECAL`,
  `getRenderNodeScale()` = density), or a bitmap blur on a 1/12 copy (`DOWN_SCALE = 12`)
  in a background thread with alpha from `key_chat_BlurAlphaSlow`.
- **Blur off or LOW class:** the bar is the opaque theme colour.

**Cost.** On a 2.6× phone, a 411 dp wide bar of about 100 dp (status bar included) is
1069 × 260 px. Its 1/8 copy is about 134 × 33 px, and the 40 dp radius (104 px, a sigma of
about 60 px) becomes a sigma of about 7.6 px on it. Cheap. The cost is the re-recording on
scroll, which the hashes keep to dirty rects.

## Ours before this change (`ui/components/Glass.kt`)

| | ours (before) | Telegram |
|---|---|---|
| capture | the whole scrolling content into one `GraphicsLayer` (`glassSource`); each glass redraws only the part under it | only the rects under glass |
| downscale | ×4 | ×8 |
| blur radius | 24 dp, divided straight by the scale (6 dp on the copy) | 40 dp, converted through sigma (≈ 4.3 dp on the copy) |
| saturation | ×1.4 | ×3 |
| bar tint | page colour at 0.72 in both themes | page colour at 0.847 light, 0.698 dark |
| floating tint | grey `#F2F2F4` / `#2C2C2E` at 0.85 | panel colour at 0.847 light, 0.76 dark |
| fallback | tint at 0.94 | opaque |
| hairline | 0.75 dp, black 9% light / white 10% dark, all round | 0.55 dp, white top and bottom (light, with a 1 dp shadow) / white 12.5% and 8% (dark) |
| fade over a dock | 32 dp: 0, 0.38, 0.7, 1 | 48 dp: 0, 0.34, 0.62, 0.81 |
| updates | the blurred layer is re-recorded every frame a glass draws (scroll or not, when invalidated) | hash-gated per rect |
| noise | none | none |
| below API 31 | tint alone | old blur path, then opaque |

## What changed to match

- `GlassSpec.DOWNSCALE` is now 8. `blur` is 40 dp. The radius on the small copy is
  `GlassSpec.downscaledRadius`, Telegram's sigma conversion.
- `SATURATION` is now 3.
- Bars (`glassBar`) use the page colour at 216/255 on a light ground and 178/255 on a dark
  one. The ground is classed as light or dark by its luminance, as Telegram's
  `isDark()` does. There is no edge, as Telegram's bar has none.
- Floating glass (the composer) uses 216/255 in light. Dark stays at **0.85, not
  Telegram's 0.76**: at 0.76 the composer's placeholder falls under 4.5:1 over a white
  picture (`ConversationComposerGlassTest`).
- The hairline is 0.55 dp, and dark's is white at `0x20`.
- The dock fade is 48 dp, with Telegram's 0, 0x60, 0xB0, 0xE8 of 285 stops. **Below the
  ramp it goes opaque instead of holding 0.81.** Our dock is narrower than the window on
  a tablet, so a 19% see-through band would show sharp content beside it.
- The bar's blur is clipped to the bar (`clipRect`), so the clamped edge of the blur can't
  spill past it.

## What stayed different, and why

- **One recorded layer, not dirty rects.** Compose's `GraphicsLayer` is already a
  RenderNode, and drawing it again inside another layer stays live. Scrolling therefore
  costs one small blur per glass surface per frame, with no re-recording of the content.
  Telegram's hash gating exists because a View-based capture has to re-record. Ours
  doesn't, so there is nothing to gate.
- **The floating tint stays our grey.** Telegram tints with its panel colour, which in light
  is white, and separates the white pill with a white stroke and a 1 dp shadow. On our white
  page that would make the composer vanish at rest. The grey tint and the dark hairline do
  that job instead.
- **No liquid-glass refraction pass.** It is off by default in Telegram too.
- **No old-path blur below API 31.** Telegram's bitmap path runs a CPU blur on a thread.
  Ours shows the tint at 0.94 instead.

## Screenshots

The before and after Robolectric renders are in `.context/shots/glass-before/` and
`.context/shots/glass-after/` (not committed). Robolectric draws RenderEffect only partly,
so the blur's real strength needs a device or emulator to judge. No Telegram reference
screenshot was taken: nothing was installed on the shared phones.
